### Project goal
This is a simple and quick microsite to showcase all my projects in one site.

### Description
I feel like the for the few last projects i have been really focusing on the backend, so i wanted to create a small site and be able to play and investigate different technologies while creating a tool to make my work easier to access, give more context and to gather all of my projects in one place.


### Technologies used:
 - Motion Framer
 - P5.js
 - Material Ui
 - React Router Dom
 - Typescript

### Features
 - On Click transitions with framer motion
 - Random background color generator
 - Auto scroll to top
 - Size Responsiveness
 - Fun red trail on cursor with p5 *(still on implementation)*

### Future
In the future i plan to investigate more the world of p5.js and the use of shaders and glsl optimization for artistic effect.
